<td><font size=4>	As students who come from varying backgrounds and walks of life, an important attribute to all of us participating in this class today is that we all paid a generous sum of money to be here, and eventually work to build our own futures in the coming years. We agreed as a whole that an important, and likely lingering issue in today's society is the inability for those who are marginalized economically to gain success compared to those who do not share these same qualities, features, etc. We decided to keep our topic broad, because the problem of economic inequality is generally broader so to speak. From the gender pay gap, to low income families being able to spend the money in order to learn the skills to compete for better jobs than the ones available to them, there is a lot more to tackle when it comes to economic inequality, and how the society we live in now typically, and naturally, pulls people back into the same situations they were in as children. What we would like to focus on mainly is the gender pay gap, low incomes families gaining success from their current situations, and how race is involved. </td>

<td><font size=4> We are talking about wealth disparity because it has and continues to be an occurring issue. As MSU students, getting accustomed to living in a dorm and being surrounded by people our age we all have realized the difference in background that we all have and the opportunities that have been given to us whether we take them or not. But zooming out of our MSU campus and being on social media you can see aspiring students that do not have the same opportunities as us right now. Most of the time the kids that don’t have the same opportunities aren't their fault it’s just where they grew up, because of where they live they couldn’t get a good education and it snowballed into them not being able to join college. Or even having the ability to get through high school. We want to change that we want every student to have the ability to go to college, we want every student to realize that it is their future and they control it.

<td><font size=4><p>There are several reasons why one should care about wealth disparity and economic inequality in society. One of the most significant and concerning is that wealth inequality will always bring about poor progress and a negative impact on social movement. When the majority of wealth is found in the possession of only a few people, it is difficult for people in lesser situations to access the same resources and opportunities that people with more wealth can actively visit in order to improve one’s financial situation. This issue allows for a steady and consistent showing of poverty, as those who do not have access to such materials cannot have the same freedom. Another reason why people should care about wealth disparity is that it can have negative consequences for society as a whole. Wealth inequality can lead to political unrest, social conflict, and other societal problems. Additionally, it can lessen trust and communication within communities, which ultimately can lead to a downfall of such communities presented. With communities upon communities reaching these social and political differences, the issue will eventually spread to cover entire economies in larger areas. With the wealth concentrated, communities without wealth to fall on will experience slow economic growth as no one is willing to invest in economic opportunities that are doomed for failure.</p>
	<p>To alleviate the severity of the wealth disparity, a real life example such as Flint, Michigan can be examined with a study done by Michigan State's own public health assistant professor, Rick Sadler. (Below this explanation are more modern examples with the top pictures of Flint being taken in 2011, and the lower pictures being taken more recently (source:Google Maps)) Flint in the 60’s and 70’s used an urban governmental standard created by Charles Tiebout, a man who favored competition to attract residents and the economy. These ideals can be reflected in the early disagreement between poorer and rich suburbs to consolidate, already showing the effects of wealth disparity in the culture. Flint's wealthier residents had no want to expand in ways of suburbanization to allow for the poorer and less privileged individuals to join their personal community, so the richer people of Flint started to constantly move out and out of the city to avoid cooperating with those they thought less to them. General Motors once held 85,000 employees in the 80’s and around “About 90 percent of Flint's wage, salary and shareholder earnings were estimated to come from local General Motors products in 1950”, make General Motors big business in Flint as well as Flint's population booming from “13,000 to more than 156,000 residents between 1900 and 1930 - a 1,000 percent gain.” so the GM managers in Flint started to move employees out of Flint, leaving their homes to be dealt with in the greatest interest of the town than the overall success of the region. The city invested these increasing funds that came with the increase in people into Interstate 475, moving businesses and residents to the wealthier parts of the city. The St. John Street residents who were moved were considered to be on the lower end of wealth disparity, living off food stamps and having a high use of welfare. This integration of the opposing sides of wealth inequality merging became known as the “White Flight”, a time period in which richer families left leaving the large groups of unemployed and poorer people as the only residents, this is another problem of wealth disparity and social inequality, also known as regionalism, with both groups being from the same area, but experiencing man made disparities that makes each one different. With no workers in the automotive plants some were demolished and others abandoned, completely destroying the base that the once great city of Flint was built upon, the city has now sunk to high crime, high unemployment, and most recently nationally known for the crippling debt and lack of revenue to clean and fix pipes that caused Flint’s water plant crisis. All of these issues however relate back to wealth disparity, with the rich of Flint investing in things that only improve their way of life while carelessly ignoring the ones with lower wealth and opportunities.</p>
	<p>Many other cities have experienced the consequences of wealth disparity, not just in Michigan but around the country. Poverty is still on the rise, crime is constant, and separation of people has always been the root cause of failure in every society ever known. Wealth disparity always comes with prejudice, and prejudice must be overcome for unlike groups to work for the betterment of their home and communities, because prejudice and judgment are core parts of the tragedy that is inequality and the reason wealth disparity exists.<a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/flint/2017/09/heres_how_flint_went_from_boom.html">Link to Flint Michigan article</a></p>

<table border=1>
<td><font size=4>	To break the generational cycles of lacking opportunity must start with the youth. America needs to do a much better job of providing children of all different backgrounds with a good start into life. We need schooling across low income areas to be improved to lower dropout rates and provide kids with better opportunities post high school. On top of this we need better community guidance to help kids stay with their families and away from child services. I also think the country could greatly benefit from a modified version of the affirmative action we saw in the past. However I think it should not be strictly based on race but a mixture of traits. Things such as where someone grew up, their economic status and that of their parents. I think this will help limit social unrest and provide the best net gain to the country as a whole. No child who is capable of reaching college should be held back because of the situation he was born into no matter what their race. After youth there also must be changes for adults in america. Companies should continue to try and diversify their business and not just for equality purposes but also for their own benefit. A solution is unlikely to ever be perfect but right now America is not doing enough. Kids who are unlucky enough to be born into a poor situation need to be helped. It will not just help them either. Who knows how many bright kids have gone down the wrong path due to limited resources. Increasing diversity will not just help minorities but the country as a whole. </td>

<td><font size=4>	A project that we encourage everyone to look into is the Mercy Education Project because of all the good things they are doing for our community. Their mission is to promote access to opportunities for women and girls in Detroit. They aid women and girls who are less fortunate in Detroit and they really focus on southwest Detroit. They offer many programs such as an after school tutoring for reading and a college and career readiness for 11th and 12th graders. We are super drawn to this project because they support everything we support. They are passionate about helping women grow in all aspects of their lives. The biggest thing we liked about the project is that they do not care about the womens’ economic situation, their beliefs or their backgrounds. It would mean a lot to us if you could donate to this cause and help the women of detroit. You can find them at http://www.mercyed.net or you can call 313-963-5881 to support today!
